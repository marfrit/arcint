# Patches carried against the pinned llama.cpp

The `--engine llama` executor (`src/exec/backend_llama.cpp`,
`docs/llama-engine.md`) builds llama.cpp as a subproject from
`ARCINT_LLAMA_DIR`. The pin is ggml-org/llama.cpp commit `bed0a85`
(2026-10-02); the tree is that commit with the patches below applied in
order:

    git -C <llama.cpp> checkout bed0a85
    git -C <llama.cpp> apply <arcint>/contrib/llama.cpp/patches/*.patch

A patch that does not apply cleanly to the pin is a bug in this directory, not
a reason to move the pin. Each patch stays PR-shaped, so it can be offered
upstream.

## 0001-opencl-intel-kquant-integer-dot-and-xmx.patch

ggml's OpenCL kernels are tuned for Adreno; on Intel Arc the K-quant matrix
products were the whole cost of the two served models, and K-quant
`MUL_MAT_ID` was not supported at all, so llama.cpp kept a K-quant MoE's
experts in host RAM and ran them on the CPU. The patch adds, for Intel GPUs
with `cl_khr_integer_dot_product` (both Arc cards here) and only there:

- **Matrix-vector, 1 to 4 columns** (`kernels/mul_mv_kq_q8_1.cl`): the
  activation quantized per 32 values to two int8 terms (codes, and the codes
  of what they leave), the weights multiplied with 4x8-bit integer dot
  products, the shape of llama.cpp's CUDA MMVQ. Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, on ggml's
  flat planes; 1 to 4 columns per pass at the cost of one (a speculative
  verify, a few lanes); `MUL_MAT_ID` one (token, slot) pair per work-group,
  the expert read on the device.
- **Matrix-matrix** (`kernels/mul_mm_kq_f16.cl`, needs
  `cl_intel_subgroup_matrix_multiply_accumulate`): weights dequantized to f16
  per work-group tile in local memory, laid out so one sub-group block read is
  one DPAS operand; activations as f16 columns (a power-of-two scale per
  column keeps them under f16's range); fp16 DPAS on the XMX units with f32
  accumulation. `MUL_MAT_ID` sorts the (token, slot) pairs by expert on the
  device and runs one tile of one expert per work-group.
- `MUL_MAT_ID` with Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K reported as supported on these devices,
  so the experts load into VRAM; and K-quant `MUL_MAT` of any column count
  exempt from the stock Adreno rule that declines 512 or more columns
  without the Adreno GEMM. llama.cpp asks `supports_op` with a 512-token op
  when it places weights, so that rule had put every small K-quant tensor
  on the CPU -- for the coder, the 60 small tensors of its gated delta-net
  layers, one GPU-CPU-GPU round trip per layer per token.
- The activation of matmuls that share an input (q/k/v, gate/up) converted
  once per graph.

The sub-group size of the DPAS kernels follows the device (8 where it is
supported, i.e. Xe-HPG; 16 on Xe2); a program a device refuses to build is
skipped and ggml's kernels take that case.

Switches: `GGML_OPENCL_KQ_Q8_1=0` turns all of it off (ggml's kernels, a
K-quant MoE's experts on the CPU); `GGML_OPENCL_KQ_MV=0` turns off the
`MUL_MAT` matvec (the `MUL_MAT_ID` matvec stays); `GGML_OPENCL_KQ_MM=0` turns
off the GEMMs; `GGML_OPENCL_KQ_MM_ID_MIN_TOK` (default 16) is the token count
from which `MUL_MAT_ID` takes the GEMM instead of the matvec;
`GGML_OPENCL_KQ_DEDUP=0` converts every activation; tile overrides
`GGML_OPENCL_KQ_MM_TILE` / `GGML_OPENCL_KQ_MM_ID_TILE` ("RG,TG,NSGM,NSGN",
checked against the device's local memory and work-group size) and
`GGML_OPENCL_KQ_Q8_1_NDST`.

Design references (`code`): llama.cpp's CUDA `vec_dot_q4_K_q8_1` and its
siblings (the q8_1 activation and the per-sub-block scaling); the DPAS operand
layouts from the emulation in bashbaug/SimpleOpenCLSamples
`20_matrixexperiments-{i8,bf16}`. An int8-activation DPAS GEMM (the CUDA MMQ
shape) was built first and dropped: it reached 20-30 TOPS but moved the dense
27B's prefill KL by 0.0028 nats and top-1 agreement by 0.9 points; the f16
GEMM is faster and leaves the KL where ggml's float kernels have it.

Measured here (`measured-here`, 2026-10-03; A770 GT clock pinned at
2000 MHz; llama-bench `-p 512 -n 128`, default batch 2048 / ubatch 512, one
sequence):

| | stock `bed0a85` | patched |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.8-27B Q4_K_M, B60: prefill 512 | 71.1 t/s | 417.9 t/s |
| Qwen3.8-27B Q4_K_M, B60: decode | 10.3 t/s | 18.0 t/s |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B coder Q4_K_M, A770: prefill 512 | 111.2 t/s (experts on the CPU) | 605.0 t/s |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B coder Q4_K_M, A770: decode | 7.7 t/s (experts on the CPU) | 37.7 t/s |

Of the coder's gain, 527 -> 605 t/s prefill and 20.9 -> 37.7 t/s decode is
the placement exemption alone, measured with the kernels unchanged.

Kernels alone (Q4_K, 17408 x 5120, one column; a standalone harness, device
time by events): matvec 84 -> 351 GB/s on the A770 and 163 -> ~400 GB/s on
the B60 (ggml's flat kernel -> this one; the B60 alternates between about
310 and 400 GB/s run to run); 2 to 4 columns cost about one. GEMM at 512
columns 34 TOPS (A770) and 41-43 TOPS (B60), against ~4 TFLOPS for ggml's.

Answers: `test-backend-ops` MUL_MAT and MUL_MAT_ID, every Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K case
on both cards (mutants of each path fail 37 to 81 cases). KL against the same
GGUF on the CPU backend, 16 chunks of 512 tokens of English and C++ text,
baseline arm ggml's float kernels: prefill (batched) dense 0.003560 ->
0.003560 nats, same top token 97.84 -> 97.82 %; coder 0.00728 -> 0.00696,
95.93 -> 96.10 %. Decode (one token per ubatch): see `docs/llama-engine.md`.
