# ligence — Design

Status: draft, pre-implementation. Numbers cited below come from the 2026-08
measurement campaigns on the actual target hardware (A770 on PCIe x4 Gen3, B60
on x8 Gen4, both behind the xe KMD).

## 1. The one idea

General-purpose engines pay for generality twice on this hardware: once in
kernel quality (Vulkan/SYCL paths that were never tuned for Xe), and once in
pipeline complexity (abstractions for hundreds of architectures the target
machine will never load). NInfer showed on CUDA what specialization buys.
On Intel, the kernel half of that bet is already won by someone else:
OpenVINO's graph compiler and kernel library emit good Xe code (measured:
3.4× llama.cpp-SYCL, 7.6× llama.cpp-Vulkan on Battlemage for the same
checkpoint). What is *not* won is the layer above — scheduling, cache
management, hybrid-state handling, sampling, serving — where OpenVINO GenAI
makes choices ligence cannot live with (see §6).

So: **OpenVINO as compiler and kernel library, ligence as everything else.**

## 2. Target constraints (facts, not choices)

- All three models are **hybrid GDN/attention** transformers. The majority of
  layers carry a fixed-size recurrent state (GatedDeltaNet: conv state +
  delta-rule state per layer); a minority are classic full-attention layers
  with a KV cache. Qwen3.8-27B is dense; the two 3.6 models are MoE with a
  shared expert.
- Recurrent state per sequence is **fixed-size and small** (tens of MB range);
  attention KV grows with context. This inverts the usual memory math: at 256k
  context the KV of the few attention layers dominates, at 4k the weights
  dominate everything.
- q4 (group-quantized int4) and q8 weight formats only. KV cache fp16 or q8.
- One card, one process. 16 GB (A770) is the binding constraint for the 35B
  MoE at q4; 22.7 GB (B60) fits any of the three with room for cache.
- Xe KMD only (i915 legacy paths are dead on the fleet). SYCL runtimes older
  than the xe transition abort on memcpy; this is why OpenVINO's OpenCL/oneDNN
  path is the only proven compute route on both cards simultaneously.

### 3.1 Model artifacts

Input format is **OpenVINO IR** produced offline (optimum-intel export, int4
AWQ or int8), one directory per model. ligence validates the IR against a
built-in allowlist (architecture hash + tensor inventory) and refuses anything
else. Calibration lessons are encoded in the allowlist: the campaign showed
that scale-estimation (SE) calibration degenerates greedy decoding on the
dense 3.8 (0/10) while AWQ-only stays healthy (7/10) — artifact provenance is
therefore part of the contract, not the user's problem.

### 3.2 Graph strategy

The transformer stack is compiled as **stateless graphs with explicit cache
I/O**: attention layers take KV page tensors in and out, GDN layers take their
recurrent state in and out. ligence owns every byte of cache; OV owns the
math. Three compiled entry points:

1. **prefill graph** — chunked, variable token count, writes KV pages and GDN
   states.
2. **decode graph** — fixed small shapes (1..k tokens per sequence for MTP
   verification), latency-tuned.
3. **mtp graph** — the native MTP head (Qwen3.8) as a separate small graph.

Compiled blobs are cached on disk. The campaign found the OV default cache
embeds weights in the blob and breaks fused-MoE import ("expert weight
provider not initialized", openvino#37607); ligence uses the weightless mode
with absolute weight paths, which was verified to import correctly (63 s warm
vs 156 s cold on the A770).

### 3.3 Memory: paged KV + GDN ledger

- **KV pages**: fixed block size (16 or 32 tokens, benchmark decides), fp16 or
  q8 per config, pool sized at startup from free VRAM after weights. Standard
  vLLM-style block tables, no eviction in v1 (a full pool rejects admission).
- **GDN ledger**: per-sequence fixed-size state slabs, plus **block-aligned
  checkpoints** for prefix caching. A checkpoint is written exactly at every
  KV-block boundary — not at a memory-tuned interval. This is the direct
  answer to OV GenAI's design (checkpoints every `block × multiplier` tokens,
  multiplier ≥ 8, sized for memory): coarse checkpoints force either state
  recomputation or approximate resume. Block-aligned checkpoints make prefix
  reuse *exact* by construction. The cost is bounded: GDN state is small, and
  the checkpoint budget is capped by config (`--gdn-checkpoint-budget`),
  degrading to sparser checkpoints *with mandatory recompute of the gap* —
  never to approximate resume.

### 3.4 Prefix caching

- Hash chain over token blocks (content hash, not pointer identity), one entry
  per (block hash, position). Collision handling is a first-class test case —
  OV GenAI shipped a collision bug (their #3489); ligence hashes with a keyed
  128-bit hash and verifies token identity on hit before reuse.
- A hit restores: KV pages by reference (copy-on-write) *and* the GDN
  checkpoint at the same block boundary. Both or neither — a prefix hit that
  cannot be satisfied for the GDN side falls back to recompute from the
  longest boundary where both exist.
- **Invariant (tested in CI, not aspirational):** for any prompt and any cache
  state, greedy output is byte-identical to a cold run. This is the
  anti-CVS-162891 stance: the equivalence test is the *gate*, and a change
  that breaks it does not merge. Failing kernels or fused paths that cannot
  meet it are configured out, not papered over.

### 3.5 Speculative decoding (MTP)

- Qwen3.8-27B: native MTP head, greedy draft of n tokens, verified in one
  decode-graph call (draft acceptance measured 45–75 % depending on language
  and domain in the vLLM campaigns; the same head, so similar rates expected).
- The 3.6 MoE pair has no bundled MTP head; the hook accepts an external
  drafter graph (dflash-style) later. v1 ships MTP for 3.8 only.
- MTP interacts with the caches trivially by design: draft tokens live in
  scratch pages and are promoted only on acceptance.

### 3.6 Sampling

Greedy, temperature, top-k, top-p, repetition penalty. On-device argmax/top-k
where the OV opset allows, host fallback otherwise. Seeded and reproducible;
`/props` reports the exact sampler configuration. Nothing else in v1.

**Model-aware defaults**: each allowlist entry carries the model card's
recommended sampler settings (the fleet learned this the hard way: greedy
decoding sends some reasoning models into thinking spirals that look like
quant damage). Requests without explicit sampler fields get the card values;
explicit fields always win; `/props` shows both.

### 3.7 Tokenizer, templates, tool calls

- **Tokenizer and chat template ship inside the model artifact** (the OV IR
  directory already carries `openvino_tokenizers` and the jinja template).
  ligence never substitutes its own copy — template drift between exporter
  and server is a measured source of silent quality loss, so the artifact is
  the single source of truth and its template hash is part of the allowlist.
- **Incremental detokenization** for streaming: UTF-8 code points are never
  split across SSE chunks; multi-token characters are held back until
  complete.
- **Stop sequences** (string and token-id) and EOS handling per request;
  `usage` (prompt/completion token counts) in every response, streamed
  responses carry it in the final chunk.
- **Tool-call parsing**: the models' native tool-call format (Qwen XML-style)
  is parsed server-side and returned as structured `tool_calls` with
  `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`, OpenAI-compatible. ligence parses, never
  executes. Requests that declare no `tools` get raw text untouched — the
  fleet's proxy learned that a parser that eats tags on tool-less requests
  makes the content silently vanish.
- **Cancellation**: a dropped client connection aborts the request's GPU work
  at the next scheduler boundary and frees its pages. Agent clients time out
  and retry; a card that keeps computing for a dead socket is wasted joules
  and a blocked slot.

### 3.8 Context-overflow policy

A prompt (or a continuation) that exceeds the model context is **rejected with
HTTP 400** and a JSON body carrying the numbers (`prompt_tokens`, `n_ctx`,
`overflow`). No server-side truncation, no llama.cpp-style context shift, no
silent sliding window — for two reasons, one principled and one physical:

1. Any server-side history edit silently changes what the model saw, breaks
   prefix-cache identity, and violates the byte-equality invariant (§3.4).
2. On hybrid GDN models a context shift is not even implementable honestly:
   KV pages can be evicted, but the recurrent linear-attention state has
   already integrated every past token — **a GDN state cannot un-see**. Every
   shift would be an approximation, i.e. exactly the class of silent
   divergence this engine exists to refuse.

History management (compaction, summarization) is the client's job, as it is
with the OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. The 400 carries enough data for the client
to do it well.

## 4. Serving surface

| endpoint | contract |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible; `stream` (SSE) and non-stream; `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` honored (the fleet standard switch) |
| `POST /v1/completions` | raw completion, same sampler surface |
| `GET /health` | 200 + JSON: model, loaded, slots free/total, queue depth |
| `GET /props` | model metadata: context length, quant, block size, KV dtype, GDN checkpoint config, MTP on/off, build info, sampler defaults |

Console output (stderr), llama.cpp tradition:

```
lgc  load: qwen3.6-27b-a3b-coder q4 | 41 GDN + 7 attn layers | weights 15.9 GiB
lgc  mem:  kv pool 4.2 GiB (2688 blocks à 32 tok) | gdn ledger 380 MiB | free 1.9 GiB
lgc  slot 0: prefill  3812 tok in  4.31 s (884.5 t/s) | cache hit 2816 tok (73.9%)
lgc  slot 0: decode    592 tok in  9.86 s ( 60.0 t/s) | mtp accept 61.2%
```

One line per event, greppable, no colors by default, `-v` raises verbosity.

## 5. Testing and acceptance

- **Prüfstand gate**: the fleet's 10-point code-generation harness runs against
  every artifact/config combination that claims production readiness. The
  reference scores to hold: 10/10 for the coder (B5-class artifact), the 3.8
  artifact must match its GGUF reference before shipping q4.
- **Equivalence suite**: cold vs warm prefix cache, cached vs uncached, MTP on
  vs off (greedy MTP must be output-invariant), chunked vs unchunked prefill —
  all byte-exact under greedy, all in CI, none skippable.
- **Determinism**: two identical greedy runs produce identical bytes (verified
  on the A770/Vulkan agent baseline as achievable on this hardware class).
- Perf regression tracking against the campaign numbers: B60 ≥ 60 t/s decode
  for the 27B coder q4 (the OpenVINO baseline it must beat to justify its
  existence), A770 ≥ 17 t/s for the dense 3.8.
- **Prefill is its own bar, not a footnote**: the llama.cpp-Vulkan agent
  measured ~58 t/s prefill on the A770 (six minutes to first token at 21k
  context) while decode quality held (9/10 at 21k depth, failure was an
  ordinary logic slip, not degeneration). Deep-context agent turns die on
  prefill, not decode. ligence tracks prefill t/s per card as a first-class
  regression metric; the OV-compiled prefill graph baseline is measured at M1
  and becomes the floor.

## 6. Why the pipeline layer is rewritten (evidence)

- OV GenAI's continuous-batching path diverges from its stateful path under
  pure greedy — reproduced on fleet hardware, measurable quality cost (−2/10
  on the code eval), reported upstream (openvino.genai#4367, unanswered).
- Their own CB-vs-stateful equality test is `@pytest.mark.skip` since
  2025-02-21 (internal ticket CVS-162891) — even for OPT-125M.
- The in-code admission "not default … due to accuracy issues"
  (Qwen2VL/Gemma3, internal tickets 171180/189844) was deleted rather than
  resolved publicly ("Remove accuracy notes", 2026-08).
- Hybrid-state prefix caching upstream checkpoints at memory-tuned intervals;
  correctness of resume between checkpoints is not equivalence-tested.
- The model cache import bug (#37607) and its workaround were found here, not
  upstream.

None of this is a reason to abandon OV's kernels — they are the fastest
correct compute on this hardware. It is the reason ligence keeps the compiler
and owns the state.

## 7. Milestones

| # | milestone | exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | skeleton: HTTP server, /health, /props, console format | curl round-trip |
| M1 | single-sequence stateless-graph inference, greedy, 27B coder q4 on B60 | Prüfstand 10/10, ≥ 45 t/s |
| M2 | paged KV + GDN ledger, chunked prefill | equivalence suite green, 256k context loads |
| M3 | prefix caching (block-aligned checkpoints) | warm/cold byte-equality, hit-rate stats on console |
| M4 | MTP for Qwen3.8, sampling beyond greedy | greedy-invariance with MTP on, measured acceptance |
| M5 | 35B MoE q4 on A770 (16 GB fit), q8 variants on B60 | all three models pass their gates |

Performance target that justifies the project, stated once: beat the OpenVINO
GenAI baseline on the same card and artifact (60 t/s, 27B q4, B60) while
holding the equivalence invariants that upstream skips.

## 8. Open questions and deliberate deferrals

- Exact KV block size (16 vs 32) and q8-KV numerics on Xe — benchmark at M2.
- Whether OV's fused SDPA is exposed cleanly enough for the decode graph, or
  whether the attention layers are better served by the PagedAttention op with
  ligence-owned page tables from day one.
- MoE expert placement on the 16 GB card: full-resident q4 vs a small
  host-spill tier for the 35B (the fleet's `-ncmoe`-style split, measured
  workable under llama.cpp, unproven under OV stateless graphs).
- External drafter (dflash-style) for the 3.6 pair: NInfer ships DFlash with
  draft windows up to 15 for exactly this model — evidence the payoff is
  real. Pulled forward to an M4/M5 decision rather than "someday".
- **Multimodal** (image/video): the target IRs are VLM exports, so the door
  is open; v1 is text-only to keep the core small. Revisit after M5.
- **Anthropic Messages API** and a **local CLI** (`--prompt`, `--messages
  FILE`): small adapters over the same executor, useful for Claude-family
  clients and offline Prüfstand runs. Candidates for M0.5, not committed.
- **Host-tier cache retention** (spill cold KV pages / GDN checkpoints to
  host RAM for longer-lived prefix reuse): NInfer does device/host state
  retention; on our PCIe x4 A770 the win is unproven. Measure before
  building.
